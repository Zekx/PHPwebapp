    <strong>TechIT: A Work-Order System</strong>
    <p>TechIT is a web application that allow users to submit work orders to technicians. The purpose of this project is to develop a functioning application that enables a way for all users to efficiently place a work request for a technician. The project utilizes MVC architecture using Java Servlets to develop the implementation so that it may be operated from a computer or a smartphone browser. The goal of this project is to create an application that is accessible for all users with an easy-to-understand interface. The structure of the application takes on a similar approach to front-end email website design where users will be able to view and compose new tickets. Technicians, supervisors, and administrators can further modify the tickets through updates, declines and completions.</p>

    <strong>Video Game Project - Python with Pygame and Unity Engine</strong>
    <p>Developed a fighting game on Python using the Pygame library. This build includes original sprite works with one functioning characeter. The game is able to play with a second player utilizing the left and right sides of the keyboard. A player wins the game if they can reduce their opponent's health points to zero.</p>
    <p>Unity is another project I have had experiences in. Developed a FPS (first-person shooter) game with multiple levels and objectives. The goal of the game is to reach the final third area without dying. Players will be able to gather items such as: healthpacks, ammo and keys while progressing. The player is also able to play from a first-person perspective or a third-person perspective.</p>
